Here are some example true/false questions related to asynchronous programming in JavaScript:

1.  JavaScript is a single-threaded language.
2.  Asynchronous programming in JavaScript uses callbacks.
3.  The event loop is a mechanism that allows the program to handle asynchronous I/O operations.
4.  `Promise.all` allows you to wait for multiple promises to resolve before continuing execution.
5.  The `await` keyword blocks the execution of code until the promise is fulfilled.
6.  setTimeout is a synchronous function in javascript.
7.  Asynchronous programming in javascript can only be done using Promises
8.  We can use `async/await` for handling synchronous code in javascript.

Answers:

1.  True
2.  True
3.  True
4.  True
5.  False, `await` keyword allows the code execution to move on without stopping and wait for promise to resolve before continuing.
6.  False, setTimeout is asynchronous function
7.  False, there are other ways to handle async operations like events, callbacks, generators etc.
8.  False, async/await are used for handling asynchronous code in javascript.
